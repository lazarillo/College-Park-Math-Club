# December 13th Session

Thanks so much for all the kids and parents that came last night!  I think the kids had a great time, and I'm confident we've already established "a practice".

-----

I'll occasionally write some notes afterwards, if either the kids or parents have any questions that we weren't able to figure out at the time, either because I didn't know, or because we ran out of time.

In other words, I won't always have notes following the session.

## Understanding infinite series

I was chatting with Karen and another of the moms (I am horrible with names, I deeply apologize for forgetting your name), and we were discussing the following infinite series:

> $s_{n} =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + ... + \frac{1}{2^{n}}$

and

> $s_{n} =  \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + ... + \frac{1}{n}$
