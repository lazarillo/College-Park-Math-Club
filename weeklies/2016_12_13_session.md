# December 13th Session

Thanks so much for all the kids and parents that came last night!  I think the kids had a great time, and I'm confident we've already established "a practice".

-----

I'll occasionally write some notes afterwards, if either the kids or parents have any questions that we weren't able to figure out at the time, either because I didn't know, or because we ran out of time.

In other words, I won't always have notes following the session.

## Understanding infinite series

I was chatting with Karen and another of the moms (I am horrible with names, I deeply apologize for forgetting your name), and we were discussing the following infinite series:

> A: $s_{n} =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + ... + \frac{1}{2^{n}}$

and

> B: $s_{n} =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + ... + \frac{1}{n}$

-----

The second series diverges (goes to infinity) as *n* goes to infinity.  This is because the series

> $s_{n} =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + ... + \frac{1}{2}$

goes to infinity (we keep adding $\frac{1}{2}$ forever), and the series

> $s_{n} =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + ... + \frac{1}{n}$

could also be written as

> $s_{n} =  \frac{1}{2} + \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8}\right) +  ... + \frac{1}{n}$

which you can hopefully see is continually adding numbers *slightly larger than* $\frac{1}{2}$, so this will diverge as well.

For the first series, I had explained it using a spatial analogy:  if you assume that *1* is a 1x1 box, then $\frac{1}{2}
