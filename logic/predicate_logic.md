# Predicate Logic
This is really where the "magic" begins.  In fact, there is so little of interest that happens in propositional logic - which does not quickly overlap into predicate logic - that I was thinking of not separating the two.

## Quick Overview
Predicate logic separates the *subject* and the *predicate* of a statement into two.  For instance,

> Mary Ann wants to eat fish.

will be represented as $$Fm$$, where $$F$$ is "to want to eat fish" and "m" is "Mary Ann".  (The predicates are typically given capital letters, while the subjects are given lower-case.)

Of course, the sentences can become more complicated,

> Mary Ann wants to eat fish and she has no money.

will be represented as $$Fm\land\neg Mm$$, where $$M$$ is now "to have money".

This then allows us to think of abstractions, notably *quantifiers* and *variables*, so that we can represent things like,

> No one eats fish who has no money.

becomes $$
